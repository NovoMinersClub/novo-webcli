# Novo Web CLI

**Novo Web CLI** is an experimental, dockerized web app that simplifies interactions with the Novo node, providing an easy-to-use interface for users.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for managing Novo node operations
- Supports both fixed token (FT) and non-fungible token (NFT) operations
- List and display FT and NFT assets with detailed information
- Designed for learning about blockchain technology and node software
- Easily issue new tokens and manage existing ones
- Accessible via a web browser at http://localhost:3000/

## Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed on your system

## Getting Started

To start using Novo Web CLI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/NovoMinersClub/novo-webcli/```


2. Change to the project directory:

```cd novo-webcli```


3. Run the `run.sh` script with sudo privileges:

Please note that building the Docker container may take some time (~30 minutes). Once the build process is complete, the application will be up and running in a Docker container, and accessible via your web browser at http://localhost:3000/.

## To-Do / Ideas

- Correct the bad display of some data related to tokens and NFTs
- Improve design
- Implement a UTXO index 
- Implement a "Search UTXO" page that allows to explore the UTXO index
- Implement a "Contracts" page that displays data related to a given contractID (holders, distributions, last transactions, ...)
- Implement a "Data Storage" page that allows to store data (files, images, tweets, ..) on chain and facilitate the creation of NFTs
- Improve the display of NFT-related data by, for example, converting metadata into images
- Implement a chat on chain with an encryption option
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Implement multi-signature wallet support
- Add support for smart contracts
